# KanaDojo v0.1.12 (December 24, 2025 patch)

## New Features
- **Calligraphy Handwriting**: A new way to practice! You can now learn to write Japanese characters stroke-by-stroke directly in the app. Find it in the Experiments section.

## Improvements
- **Smarter Learning Curve**: We've refined the "Smart Reverse Mode" to better balance when to show you Japanese vs. Romaji, making for a more natural progression as you master characters.
- **Navigation Update**: The sidebar has been reorganized to make your Progress more accessible. We've also updated icons across the app for a cleaner look.
- **Enhanced Achievement View**: The achievements page has been completely rebuilt to be faster and better organized. We've also added a "Recalculate" feature to ensure your progress is always up to date.
- **Sleek UI Tweaks**: Level selection modals now have a more intuitive design with better visual feedback on your selections.

## Bug Fixes
- **Gauntlet Settings Persistence**: Fixed a bug where your chosen difficulty and game mode wouldn't correctly carry over into the Gauntlet game.
- **Icon Rendering**: Resolved several issues with icons not displaying the correct colors or weights in certain parts of the sidebar.
- **Stability**: Fixed several underlying bugs related to navigation and translation loading to ensure a smoother experience.
